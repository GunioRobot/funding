%h2 $1000 and coworking space for your company

  Traction is the secret sauce of success in early stage startups and can be achieved with ever-decreasing amounts of capital.
  Simply stated, traction is proving that customers are willing to pay for your product.
  Traction can enable a business to sustain itself through bootstrapping, prove market interest, and attract investment.

%p
  ScaleWellNU is a catalyst for startup traction - 
  By providing one team or an individual entrepreneur with a $1000 grant 
  we want entrepreneurs to explore important questions like: 
  How many customers can be acquired for $1000 or 
  how far will a small sum move a company toward profitability? 
  The best way to develop answers to these questions is to DO IT. 
  Build the product, get customers, and collect metrics along the way.

  The small amount of capital ScaleWell injects into a startup takes the company to its next milestone or iteration on its business plan.
  We call it Iterative Capital, just enough money, motivation, and support to successfully iterate in a startup.

  Why scalable businesses?
  
%p
  Scalability has many definitions but the core concept is a business that makes more profit the more product it sells.
  This asymmetry of revenues and costs means the business has the potential to be very profitable, grow rapidly and produce long lasting value.

  How is ScalewellNU different?

%p
  ScalewellNU is a challenge to the Northwestern community, what can a business achieve with a amount of capital? 
  Entrants to business plan competitions focus on what they can do with tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars- 
  but can they take advantage of $1000 and the support of the Northwestern community?

%h2
  Do I have to be a Northwestern student to apply

%p
  Absolutely not! Good ideas come from everywhere. 
  The grant is supported by Northwestern trustees, but anyone can apply. 
  Finalists are required to attend an interview in Evanston just before the award party.

  Giving money with no return? Are you crazy?
  
%p
  It's not rocket science. 
  The ScaleWellNU trustees like entrepreneurs and want to help create more successful and innovative companies. 
  Getting traction at an early-stage helps reduce the time necessary to build a scalable product and repeatably acquire new customers. 
  ScaleWellNU provides capital and support at the lowest possible entry point.
