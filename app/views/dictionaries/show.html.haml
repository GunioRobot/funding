  ScaleWell FAQ

#faq
  %p
    %span.bold.red Do applicants have to be located in Chicago?
    %ul
      %li No. You can be anywhere in the world and we will at minimum attempt         |
       to provide valuable feedback from our growing community of trustees.           |
       However, applicants outside of Chicago will not be able to utilize co-working  |
       space at OfficePort and will also miss networking opportunities.               |
  %p
    %span.bold.red  Can I submit more than one application?
    %ul
      %li You can submit multiple applications if the team members and project are    |
      sufficiently different.  For example, you could submit a project built entirely |
      by yourself and another you are incubating with two friends.  If you have more  |
      ideas - don't worry - just wait until the next grant period for ScaleWell.      |
  %p
    %span.bold.red  Can I be a trustee and an applicant simultaneously?
    %ul
      %li Unfortunately, you cannot be an applicant and a trustee at the same time.   |
      Providing feedback and mentorship for your own company might pose a conflict of |
      interest. |
  %p
    %span.bold.red  Is this altruistic or do you have ulterior motives?
    %ul
      %li ScaleWell is currently an altruistic project intended to provide            |
      recognition, motivation, and support for startups at the ground level.          |
      Chicago, specifically, lacks an infrastructure to support companies at this     |
      level and help educate entrepreneurs about company growth.  However, we are not |
      opposed to growing into a profitable enterprise in the future IF we develop a   |
      revenue stream that does not dilute the value of ScaleWell.                     |
  %p
    %span.bold.red My business idea is a secret will the applications be made public?
    %ul
      %li We will not release the applications to the general public.
